**WTF is a spindle?**

Welcome to the Environment of Care section of the WHMC Intraweb.  In this section you will find everything you need regarding the EOC. 
 
What is the Environment of Care?
 
The Environment of Care is made up of three basic elements:
 •The building or space, including how it is arranged and the special features that protect patients, visitors, and staff.
 •Equipment used to support patient care or to safely operate the building or space.
 •People, including those who work within the hospital, patients, and anyone else who enters the environment, all of whom have a role in minimizing risks.
 
How do I contribute to the Environment of Care?
 
Any hospital, regardless of its size or location, faces risks in the environment, including those associated with safety and security, fire, hazardous materials and waste, medical equipment, and utility systems. When staff are educated about the elements of a safe environment, they are more likely to follow processes for identifying, reporting, and taking action on environmental risks.
